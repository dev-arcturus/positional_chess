# Chess Analysis Studio

A browser-based chess analysis tool. **Stockfish runs in the browser via WebAssembly** — there is no backend. Load any position, see the engine's evaluation in real time, browse top candidate moves with their principal variations, and get a plain-language explanation of *why* a move is good, bad, or brilliant.

This is the kind of analysis cockpit you'd find on Lichess, scaled down to a single-page app you can self-host on any static host (or Vercel — see [Deploy to Vercel](#deploy-to-vercel)).

> **Heads-up:** the `server/` directory is now **legacy**. The full analysis pipeline lives in `client/src/engine/`. The server is kept around as reference for the same logic — you do not need to run it.

## Highlights

- **Browser-side Stockfish 18 (lite, single-threaded WASM)** — depth 12–14 search, MultiPV up to 10, principal variation extraction. ~7 MB WASM, gzipped on the wire.
- **No backend** — pure static deploy. Works offline once the WASM has been fetched once.
- **Hold ⇧ Shift (or just start dragging) to reveal positional values.** The board stays clean by default; pressing Shift — or grabbing any piece — overlays a numeric badge on every piece showing its contextual worth (in pawns), color-interpolated by significance.
- **Live "what-if" preview during drag.** Hover a piece over a legal destination — every label on the board updates to show how each piece's worth changes if you complete the move. Includes the opponent's pieces.
- **Hanging-piece warnings.** Any piece whose cheapest attacker is less valuable than the piece itself gets a red inset border, so you never miss a loose piece.
- **Best-move green ring.** When you pick up or click a piece and the engine's top recommendation starts on that square, the destination is outlined in green — instant "is this the move?" cue.
- **Material balance + king safety + phase indicator** in the toolbar — quick reads on who's up material, who's exposed, and whether it's an opening / middlegame / endgame.
- **Last-move card at the top of the analysis panel.** The move that got you to the current position is shown with its full classification (`brilliant` / `great` / `best` / `good` / `neutral` / `inaccuracy` / `mistake` / `blunder`), summary, details, and "better was X" alternative.
- **Arrow-key navigation.** ←/↑ for previous position, →/↓ for next.
- **Top moves panel with motif taglines.** Each candidate move comes with a short positional summary ("Develops the knight, threatens the bishop") generated locally without engine calls. Click a move and the next 2 plies of the engine's PV each get their own one-liner too.
- **Move explainer** — Lichess-style win-rate sigmoid + tactical motif detection. `brilliant` requires top-1 engine choice + real (SEE-based) sacrifice + win-rate maintained.
- **Click-to-select + drag-and-drop** with Lichess-style legal-move dots and capture rings. Dots also appear underneath a piece while it's being dragged.
- **FEN load + history scrubber + Random button** with 20 curated plausible positions for demos.
- **LRU cache** in-memory, keyed on `(fen, depth, multipv)` — scrolling back through your move history is instant after the first pass.

---

## Demo Flow

1. Open the page → Stockfish WASM loads in a Web Worker (~1–2 s on first visit; cached afterwards).
2. Starting position renders, eval bar at `0.0`.
3. Make a move on the board → engine re-evaluates → eval bar swings, top-moves list refreshes.
4. Click any move in the top-moves list → blue arrow shows the suggestion, explainer opens with rating + reasoning.
5. Paste a FEN → board jumps to that position; analysis follows.
6. Step backwards through history → state rewinds; cached evaluations make this instant.

Everything happens in the browser. The Worker runs the Stockfish engine; the main thread orchestrates analysis, runs the move explainer, and renders the board. There is no server in the request path.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+** (Node 20.19 / 22.12 recommended for Vite 7).
- A modern browser with WebAssembly support (Chromium, Firefox, Safari, Edge — anything from the last ~5 years).

That's it. **No Stockfish system binary, no server, no Docker.**

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone <your-fork-url> chess_project
cd chess_project/client
npm install
```

`npm install` will download the `stockfish` package; the WASM file used at runtime is already checked into `client/public/stockfish/` (it's content-addressable and ~7 MB).

---

## Running Locally

```bash
cd client
npm run dev          # Vite dev server, usually http://localhost:5173
```

Open the URL Vite prints. First load fetches the WASM (~7 MB, gzipped to ~3 MB on the wire). Subsequent loads use the browser's HTTP cache.

### Production build

```bash
npm run build        # outputs to client/dist/  (~7.3 MB total: WASM dominates)
npm run preview      # serve the built bundle locally
```

---

## Deploy to Vercel

The repo ships with a [`vercel.json`](./vercel.json) that handles the monorepo layout:

- `installCommand`: `cd client && npm ci`
- `buildCommand`: `cd client && npm run build`
- `outputDirectory`: `client/dist`
- Long-lived `Cache-Control` headers on `/stockfish/*` and `/assets/*` (both are content-addressable).

### One-shot deploy

```bash
npm i -g vercel        # if you don't have it
vercel                 # follow the prompts; pick the right team/project name
vercel --prod          # promote to production
```

### Or via the Vercel dashboard

1. **Import** the GitHub repo at <https://vercel.com/new>.
2. Leave **Root Directory** at the repo root (`vercel.json` handles the rest).
3. Click **Deploy**.

That's the entire pipeline. No environment variables, no add-ons, no backend service. The deployed URL serves the static SPA and the WASM, and Stockfish runs in every visitor's browser.

### Other static hosts

The same pattern works on Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, S3+CloudFront, or any static host — point them at `client/dist` after running `npm run build`. You may want to set `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` on `/stockfish/*` and `/assets/*` to match the Vercel headers.

---

## Public API (`client/src/engine/`)

`client/src/engine/analysis.js` is the orchestration layer the UI talks to. The shapes match what the (legacy) server endpoints used to return, so the rest of the app didn't have to change much.

```js
import {
  getTopMoves,
  getBestMove,
  explainMoveAt,
} from './engine/analysis';

// Top N candidate moves for a position (1 ≤ N ≤ 10)
const r = await getTopMoves(fen, 10);
// → { fen, eval_cp, mate, moves: [{ rank, move, san, eval_cp, eval_pawns, pv, isMate, mateIn }, ...] }

// Best move plus principal variation
const r = await getBestMove(fen);
// → { fen, bestMove, san, from, to, eval_cp, mate, pv: [san, ...] }

// Explain a move you just made
const r = await explainMoveAt(fen, 'e2e4');
// → { san, summary, details, quality, factors, motifs, evalBefore, evalAfter, evalDelta, winRateDelta, isTopMove }
```

`quality` is one of: `brilliant | great | best | good | neutral | inaccuracy | mistake | blunder`.
`motifs` is a subset of: `capture | check | checkmate | stalemate | fork | pin | discovered-check | removal-of-defender | sacrifice | castling-kingside | castling-queenside | en-passant | promotion | threefold-repetition | fifty-move-rule | insufficient-material`.

For lower-level access, `client/src/engine/engine.js` exposes `evaluate(fen, depth)`, `analyzeMultiPV(fen, n, depth)`, and `getBestMove(fen, depth)` directly on the Stockfish wrapper.

---

## How positional values are computed

The headline visualization is the **per-piece pawn-value badge** that
appears when you hold Shift. The number on each piece is what the engine
thinks the position would lose if the piece were removed. Concretely, for
a piece on square *S* belonging to side *C*:

```
baseEval     = Stockfish.evaluate(fen, depth=10)
evalWithout  = Stockfish.evaluate(fenWithoutPieceOn(S), depth=10)
delta_cp(S)  = baseEval − evalWithout   if C is white
             = evalWithout − baseEval   if C is black
delta_cp(S)  = clamp(delta_cp(S), −1500, +1500)
```

Two corrections protect the math from mate-encoded scores (the engine
returns ≈ ±100,000 cp for "mate in N"):

1. `ownerValue(eval)` translates either side of the eval to a sane
   owner-relative value. Mate scores fold into ±1000 (owner mates / owner
   gets mated), cp values clamp at ±1500. This stops the naïve subtraction
   from blowing up to ≈ ±1000 pawns.
2. The final `delta_cp` is clamped to **±500 cp** (5 pawns). 5 is enough
   to convey "very important" without making every piece around a mating
   attack read identically as `+15.0` (which conveys no information).

**Delta during drag** is the same thing for the post-move position: when
you hover over a legal destination, every piece's `delta_cp` is recomputed
on the hypothetical post-move FEN and we show the difference vs. its
current value, in pawns. ~16 engine evals per hover, cached per FEN.

## Color interpolation (significance-aware)

Both the labels and (formerly) the square tints use a single significance
curve, but the **scale depends on the piece type** so that a –80 cp drop
on a rook reads lighter than the same drop on a bishop:

```
relative   = |delta_cp| / typical_piece_value
magnitude  = 1 − exp(−relative · calibration)
color      = lerp(white, sign>0 ? green-500 : red-500, magnitude)
```

`typical_piece_value` is `{p:100, n:300, b:320, r:500, q:900}`. We use
`calibration=2` for absolute piece-worth labels and `calibration=3` for
deltas (small swings on big pieces stay near-white; small swings on small
pieces saturate fast). Calibration was tuned against the design intent
"60 cp should read as considerable":

| Piece    | −80 cp  | relative | magnitude (c=3) | result        |
| -------- | ------- | -------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| Pawn     | −80     | 0.80     | 0.91            | strong red    |
| Bishop   | −80     | 0.25     | 0.53            | clear red     |
| Knight   | −80     | 0.27     | 0.55            | clear red     |
| Rook     | −80     | 0.16     | 0.38            | light red     |
| Queen    | −80     | 0.09     | 0.23            | barely tinted |

That matches intuition: an 80 cp drop is small for a queen, big for a pawn.

## Label rendering

- Big (22 px) bold monospace, centered in each square.
- No drop-shadow. Instead a heavy (4 px) text-stroke painted **before** the
  fill in opaque black (`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.92)`), with bright fills (white
  for ~0, green-300 / red-300 for saturated swings). `paint-order: stroke
  fill` keeps the colored fill crisp on top of the stroke. This is the
  same approach used for legible subtitles on photo/video — it works on
  any underlying square color or piece icon without competing with them.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Key                | Action                                       |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `⇧ Shift` (hold)   | Reveal piece-value heatmap                   |
| `←` or `↑`         | Previous position (history)                  |
| `→` or `↓`         | Next position (history)                      |

Heatmap is **also** automatically on while a piece is being dragged, so
the Shift-and-drag combo doesn't fight with the browser's drag handlers
— you can just grab a piece and the live preview kicks in.

## Motif catalog (~50 detectors)

`client/src/engine/taglines.js` runs every top move (and the first 3 plies
of its PV) through `quickExplain` — pure chess.js + geometry, no engine
calls. The catalog below describes what each detector actually checks.
Detectors are conservative: they prefer to miss a motif than to fire a
wrong one.

### Tactical
- `checkmate` / `stalemate` — chess.js terminal-state methods.
- `fork` — moved piece attacks ≥ 2 enemy pieces, at least one is the
  king or worth more than the moving piece.
- `pin` — sliding piece's outward ray contains an enemy piece, then a
  more valuable enemy piece behind it.
- `skewer` — same ray, but the first enemy is more valuable than the
  second (forces the bigger piece to move and lose the smaller).
- `discovered_check` — opponent is in check and the checker is **not**
  the moved piece.
- `sacrifice` — moving piece is left hanging (cheapest attacker < piece
  value) for net material loss ≥ 200 cp.
- `threatens` — moved piece attacks a single enemy piece worth more
  than itself.
- `creates_threat` — an opponent piece that wasn't hanging before is
  now hanging.
- `defends` — a friendly piece that was hanging before is no longer
  hanging.
- `traps_piece` — among the enemy pieces our moved piece attacks, at
  least one has zero safe moves (every legal move lands on a hanging
  square). Validated by actually applying each candidate move and
  checking the resulting hanging state.
- `hangs` — the moving piece itself is left hanging (and didn't recoup
  enough material to count as a sacrifice).

### Captures and trades
- `queen_trade` — queen captures queen.
- `piece_trade` — captured piece is the same type as the mover.
- `exchange_sacrifice` — rook captures minor piece (or vice versa via
  the SEE-style sacrifice path).
- `capture` — generic, when none of the more-specific trade motifs fire.
- `en_passant`, `promotion` — flag-driven.

### King area
- `castles_kingside` / `castles_queenside`.
- `connects_rooks` — after castling, both rooks share the back rank
  with no pieces between them.
- `attacks_king` — moved piece is now closer to the enemy king than
  before, and within 3 squares (only fires when no stronger tactical
  motif applies).
- `luft` — back-rank king + a pawn within two files of it advances by
  one square. Standard "make a hole for the king" idea.
- `pawn_storm` — a pawn move on the same wing as the enemy king,
  advanced past its starting rank, with at least one **other** friendly
  pawn already advanced on the same wing.

### Pieces
- `develops` — knight or bishop moves off the back rank in the opening
  (move number ≤ 12).
- `centralizes` — actual gain in central-square attack count of ≥ 1.5
  (core central squares d4/d5/e4/e5 count double). Doesn't fire just
  because a piece lands on d4 — only when the move *increases* central
  control.
- `outpost` — knight/bishop moves to a square no enemy pawn can ever
  attack, **and** that's either pawn-supported or on rank 5+ (white) /
  rank 4– (black).
- `fianchetto` — bishop to b2/g2 (white) or b7/g7 (black).
- `knight_on_rim` — knight ends on the a- or h-file in the opening
  (move number ≤ 16). Anti-pattern.
- `bad_bishop` — bishop ends on a position where ≥ 5 friendly pawns
  share its color complex (it's hemmed in by its own pawns).
- `bishop_pair_lost` — moving bishop is captured/traded such that we go
  from 2 bishops to 1, while opponent had 2.

### Rooks and files
- `doubles_rooks` — two same-color rooks on the same file after the
  move.
- `open_file` / `semi_open_file` — rook to a file with no friendly
  pawns; "semi-open" if there are enemy pawns on it, "open" if neither.
- `rook_seventh` — rook on its 7th rank (rank 7 for white, rank 2 for
  black).
- `battery` — sliding piece moves so it shares a ray with another
  same-color slider AND that ray terminates at an enemy king, queen, or
  rook. Doesn't fire on aimless line-up.

### Pawn structure
- `pawn_break` — pawn captures another piece.
- `pawn_lever` — single-step pawn push that lands diagonally adjacent
  to an enemy pawn (next move can capture).
- `passed_pawn` — pawn ends on a square with no enemy pawn ahead in
  the same or adjacent files.
- `doubled_pawns_them` — capturing creates a doubled pawn for the
  opponent on the captured file.
- `isolated_pawn` — pawn ends on a file where no friendly pawn occupies
  either adjacent file.
- `backward_pawn_them` — an enemy pawn that wasn't backward before
  becomes backward after the move (no friendly pawn behind on adjacent
  files, and the front square is blocked or covered by an enemy pawn).

### Strategic / contextual
- `restricts` — opponent's pseudo-legal-move count drops by ≥ 4 after
  the move.
- `tempo` — composite: develops + (threatens / attacks_king / creates_threat).

### Fallback policy: silence over filler
If we can't say something *non-obvious* about a move, the tagline is
**empty** and the panel just renders the SAN + eval. Generic phrasing
like "Repositions the rook to b1" or "Pushes the a-pawn to a4" simply
restates the move notation — better to stay silent.

The fallback ladder only emits text for two specific cases:

- **Strong activity gain or loss** (≥ 4 squares attacked Δ): "Activates
  the knight (eyes 9 squares)" / "Pulls the rook back into a passive role"
- **Pawn pushes that materially do something**: 7th-rank push, or a push
  that newly attacks an enemy piece on a diagonal

Anything quieter — back-rank shuffles, pawn moves with no immediate
target — gets no tagline.

### High-signal positional detectors (added this pass)
- **`prepares_castling_kingside` / `_queenside`** — minor piece moves
  off the back rank, freeing the path between king and rook on a side
  where castling rights still exist. Combined with `develops` to
  produce "Develops the bishop, preparing to castle kingside".
- **`attacks_pawn`** — the moved piece *newly* attacks an enemy pawn.
  Surfaces the pawn's weakness when applicable: "Attacks the backward
  d-pawn", "Attacks the isolated c-pawn".
- **`eyes_king_zone`** — long-range piece (B/R/Q) whose newly-attacked
  squares include any of the 3×3 zone around the enemy king. Combined
  with `develops` to produce "Develops the bishop, eyeing the king's
  position".

### Combined phrasing
Some motif pairs read more naturally combined:

- `castles_kingside` + `connects_rooks` → "Castles kingside, connecting the rooks"
- `capture` + `discovered_check` → "Captures the X with discovered check"
- `capture` + `check` → "Captures the X with check"
- `develops` + `threatens` → "Develops the knight with tempo (threatens the bishop)"
- `develops` + `outpost` → "Develops the knight, establishes an outpost on f5"

## Original motif catalog (taglines)

`client/src/engine/taglines.js` runs every top move through `quickExplain`
— pure chess.js + geometry, no engine calls. Each move gets a short
tagline composed from up to two of the highest-priority motifs detected:

**Tactical**: `checkmate`, `sacrifice`, `fork`, `pin`, `skewer`,
`discovered_check`, `removal_of_defender`, `hangs`, `threatens`, `defends`.

**Trades & captures**: `queen_trade`, `piece_trade`, `exchange_sacrifice`,
`capture`, `en_passant`, `promotion`.

**King**: `castles_kingside`, `castles_queenside`, `connects_rooks`,
`attacks_king`, `check`.

**Rooks & files**: `doubles_rooks`, `open_file`, `semi_open_file`,
`rook_seventh`, `battery`.

**Pieces & development**: `develops`, `centralizes`, `outpost`,
`fianchetto`, `tempo`.

**Pawn play**: `pawn_break`, `pawn_lever`, `passed_pawn`, `pawn_storm`,
`doubled_pawns_them`, `isolated_pawn`.

**Endgame states**: `stalemate`, `threefold_repetition`, `fifty_move`,
`insufficient_material`.

Tagline composition picks the top 1–2 motifs by priority and joins them
with a comma. So a knight move that captures a pawn and attacks the queen
reads "Captures the pawn, threatens the queen" (capture > threatens in
priority).

`explainPV` runs `quickExplain` for the first 3 plies of the engine's
preferred line, building a mini-narrative under the selected move:

```
1. Nf3   Develops the knight, threatens the bishop
   Nc6   Develops the knight
   Bb5   Pins the knight to the king
```

## Hanging-piece detection

For every non-king piece on the board, we ask chess.js for `attackers()`
and `defenders()` and apply a cheap-attacker test: if there's any attacker
worth less than the piece itself, the piece is hanging (cheapest exchange
loses material). Hanging squares get a red inset `boxShadow` so loose
pieces are immediately visible.

## Best-move green ring

When you click or pick up a piece, we look at the engine's top move from
the current top-moves response. If it starts on the same square, the
destination square gets a **green inset ring** (the same trick used for
hanging pieces but in green, not red). This gives an instant "is this
the move?" answer without having to read the analysis panel.

## King safety (0–9 overlay on each king)

Pure-FEN heuristic, no engine calls. Components:

- **Pawn shield** (max 6) — pawns directly in front of the king on the
  three files `[kf-1, kf, kf+1]`. A pawn one rank ahead scores 2; two
  ranks ahead scores 1. (So `f2 g2 h2` for a kingside-castled white
  king = 2+2+2 = 6.)
- **Open files near king** — files in `{kf-1, kf, kf+1}` with no
  friendly pawn anywhere. Each one deducts 1.5 points.
- **Attacker weight** — enemy pieces attacking any of the 9 squares in
  the king's 3×3 zone. Pieces are weighted `p:1, n:2, b:2, r:3, q:4`,
  with each attack instance deducting 0.5 points.
- **Castled bonus** — `+1.5` if the king is on the g- or c-file at the
  back rank.
- **Central exposure penalty** — `-3` if the king is on file 2–5 and
  rank 2–5 (out in the middle of the board).

```
raw   = shield − 1.5·openFiles − 0.5·attackerWeight
        + (castled ? 1.5 : 0) − (central ? 3 : 0)
score = round( (clamp(raw, -12, 8) + 12) / 20 · 9 )
```

Rendered as a single digit on each king's square (32 px, heavy black
stroke + bright fill). 0 = wide-open king, 9 = locked-down safe. Color
interpolated from saturated red at 0 through white near 4–5 through
saturated green at 9.

## Material balance + phase

Both are derived from the FEN with no engine calls:

- **Material delta** = sum of `{p:1, n:3, b:3, r:5, q:9}` for white minus
  same for black, displayed as a small green/red badge near the eval.
- **Phase**: `opening` if non-pawn-non-king material is ≥ 30 and move
  number ≤ 12, `endgame` if material ≤ 14, otherwise `middlegame`. Shows
  as an uppercase tag in the header.

## Move classification (Lichess-style)

The classifier matches Lichess's `lila` exactly for the win-rate sigmoid
and the loss thresholds:

```
winRate(cp) = 100 / (1 + exp(-0.00368208 · clamp(cp, -1000, +1000)))
loss        = winRate(bestMoveCp) − winRate(playedMoveCp)   (mover POV, in pp)
```

Loss thresholds (in win-rate percentage points), Lichess values:

| Loss     | Verdict      |
| -------- | ------------ |
| `< 10`   | `good`       |
| `< 20`   | `inaccuracy` |
| `< 30`   | `mistake`    |
| `≥ 30`   | `blunder`    |

On top of the loss ladder we layer three contextual judgments:

- **`brilliant`** — the played move is the engine's top-1 AND it
  involves a real material sacrifice (cheap-attacker check via SEE)
  AND the position wasn't already won (`wrBefore < 85`).
- **`great`** — top-1 with `onlyMoveGap ≥ 10` (the second-best
  alternative is at least 10 pp worse). Catches "only move that holds".
- **`missed_mate`** — the engine's top move had a mate score and the
  played move did not. Surfaces missed forced mates that the loss
  ladder alone might rate as `good` (because both positions are still
  100 % winning by win-rate).

Final ladder, in priority order:

```
brilliant > great > best > missed_mate > {good, inaccuracy, mistake, blunder}
```

`best` is the consolation for top-1 moves that don't qualify as
brilliant or great. Anything not top-1 falls through to either
`missed_mate` (if the engine had a mate that we missed) or the loss
ladder.

## Last-move analysis card

Whenever the user lands on a non-starting position (move played, history
nav, FEN load), the analysis panel's top card runs the full
`explainMoveAt` on the move that produced the current position and shows:

- **Quality badge**: `brilliant` / `great` / `best` / `good` / `neutral`
  / `inaccuracy` / `mistake` / `blunder` — color-coded.
- **Win-rate loss vs. best** if not the engine's top choice.
- Summary + details (uses the same `explainer.js` pipeline that drives
  the click-a-move-to-explain flow).
- "Better was X" line when the played move wasn't best.

## How the Analysis Pipeline Works

### 1. Stockfish WASM Worker (`client/src/engine/engine.js`)
A single Stockfish process runs in a Web Worker. The wrapper:
- Buffers `postMessage` lines so partial UCI responses are never lost.
- Performs a `uci` → `isready` → `readyok` handshake before accepting jobs.
- Enforces a 15-second timeout per job (sends UCI `stop` then rejects, so the queue can't wedge).
- Returns `{ cp, mate }` from `evaluate()` so callers can distinguish `+9.99` pawns from "mate in 3."
- Caches results in an LRU keyed on `(fen, depth, multipv)`.

### 2. Top moves
Sets `setoption name MultiPV value N`, runs a single search, and harvests the deepest `info` line per `multipv` slot.

### 3. The explainer (`client/src/engine/explainer.js`)
- **Win-rate sigmoid** — `winRate(cp) = 100 / (1 + e^(-cp/300))`, the same shape Lichess uses. Thresholds operate on the *win-rate delta* from the mover's perspective.
- **Engine top-1 / top-2 reference** — fetched alongside the eval. The player's move is compared against the engine's top choice; matching it plus a real material sacrifice (the moving piece is now hanging for ≥ 200 cp net) upgrades the verdict to `brilliant`.
- **Tactical motif detection** — fork, pin, discovered check, removal-of-defender, sacrifice.
- **Terminal-state shortcuts** — `chessAfter.isCheckmate()` returns immediately with quality `brilliant`; `isStalemate()` flags accidental stalemates as a blunder when the side was previously winning.
- **Positional factors** — PST-based activity, center occupation, development (gated to `moveNumber ≤ 12`), and king-attack proximity.

## Known Gaps and Problems

### Performance
- **WASM Stockfish runs at ~30-50% of native speed.** Single-threaded by choice — using the multi-threaded build would require setting Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy / Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy headers and accepting the deployment complexity. At depth 12 the single-threaded build still answers in well under a second on a modern laptop.
- **First-load WASM download is ~7 MB** (about 3 MB gzipped on the wire). Aggressive `Cache-Control` minimises this on repeat visits.

### Client polish
- **API URL** is no longer used (axios is dead code in `package.json` — should be removed).
- **`alert()` for invalid FEN.** Inline error UI would be friendlier and testable.
- **Auto-promotion to queen.** The engine and explainer support under-promotion, but the UI never offers a knight/rook/bishop choice.
- **Fixed 520 × 520 board.** No responsive layout, unusable on mobile.
- **Tailwind is configured but barely used.** Either commit to Tailwind or drop the dev dependency.
- **`TopMoves.jsx` and `MoveExplanation.jsx` are unused.** The equivalent UI is inlined into `Board.jsx`.
- **No accessibility pass.**
- **Game-status flags** (checkmate / stalemate / threefold / 50-move / insufficient material) are surfaced by the explainer but not rendered in dedicated UI.

### Chess-specific gaps
- **No PGN import/export.**
- **No opening book or endgame tablebase** (Stockfish does the work even for trivial positions).
- **No play-vs-engine / multiplayer / persistence.** This is an analysis cockpit, not a game server.
- **Skewer detection** is approximated by the pin detector; a dedicated motif would be cleaner.

### Cross-cutting
- **No tests.** The explainer's tactical motif logic in particular has enough heuristics that snapshot tests on hand-picked positions would be the highest-leverage place to start.

## Roadmap / Future Work

### Quick wins
- [ ] Remove unused `axios` dependency from `client/package.json`.
- [ ] Replace `alert()` for invalid FEN with inline error UI.
- [ ] Render the explainer's `motifs[]` array as chips on the move-explanation panel (factors are already rendered).
- [ ] Surface game-end states (checkmate / stalemate / threefold / 50-move / insufficient material) in the UI.
- [ ] Delete or wire up `TopMoves.jsx` / `MoveExplanation.jsx`.

### Medium-effort improvements
- [ ] **Responsive board** (percentage / `vmin`-based layout).
- [ ] **Under-promotion modal.** Ask the user which piece on pawn promotion.
- [ ] **PGN import/export.** Trivial with `chess.js`.
- [ ] **Engine controls UI.** Expose depth + MultiPV in a settings panel.
- [ ] **First test suite.** Snapshot tests for the explainer (each motif on a hand-picked position).
- [ ] **Multi-threaded Stockfish.** Switch to `stockfish-18-lite.js` (multi-threaded build) and add COOP/COEP headers in `vercel.json` for ~2-4× search speedup.
- [ ] **Loading UX.** Show a small "Loading engine…" indicator on first visit while the WASM downloads.
- [ ] **Service worker / PWA install.** Cache the WASM offline-first; the app already works offline once loaded.

### Bigger directions
- [ ] **Play-vs-engine mode.** Use Stockfish's `setoption name Skill Level` to dial difficulty; add a clock UI.
- [ ] **Game review mode.** Walk a full PGN, run the explainer on every move, surface the worst blunders.
- [ ] **Opening explorer.** Polyglot book lookups so opening moves don't waste engine time.
- [ ] **Endgame tablebase.** Syzygy 6-piece via a remote service (or WASM tablebase if available).
- [ ] **Multiplayer.** Would require a backend — at that point the legacy `server/` code becomes useful again.
- [ ] **Better tactical detection.** Real Static Exchange Evaluation (SEE) for sacrifice scoring; explicit skewer / zwischenzug recognition.
